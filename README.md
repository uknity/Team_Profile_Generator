## Description

In this project, I used the inquirer npm to prompt the user to answer employment questions.  The first questions related to the manager's employee id, email, and office number.  Those answers were added to a manager array.  Next, the user is prompted whether he/she would like to add an engineer or intern to the team.  Based on that input, a second series of questions begins.  Engineers are asked about their GitHub profiles.  Interns are asked about their school.  When finished, the user is prompted whether he/she would like to add another employee.  The cycle continues until the user selects "no".  At that point, classes of employees are created based on the user input.  These classes are used to generate HTML cards for an HTML file displaying the data.

## Installation

Please ensure that Node.JS is installed on your computer.  If not, please visit https://nodejs.org/en and follow the download instructions.  Open the project in your code editor and open the terminal.

## Usage

Please open the files in VS Code or your preferred code editor. In the terminal, type, "node index.js".  Answer the prompted questions about your project. The project will generate an HTML file displaying the results of the team.  You may click on each email to automatically open your email server with an email addressed to the applicable employee.  In addition, if you click on the engineer's GitHub profile, you will be directed to that page in a separate tab.  

## Credits

This project was completed with the assistance of the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp.

## Test

To test the application, you may follow the usage guidelines to generate a sample HTML.  In addition, if you open package.json in the terminal, you may enter "npm run tests" to test the functionality of the program.
